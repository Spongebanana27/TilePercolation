## Tile Percolation

This is a project inspired by this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-767WnbaCQ&t=3s&ab_channel=SpectralCollective

I was fascinated by the concept as well as visuals, so I've tried my hand at making my own version: Tile Percolation

There are a lot of features I plan on adding, right now it is the absolute bare-bones, functioning inefficiently and with a terrible user input system.

## Plans:

- UI
- Visually satisfying percolation process
- Optimization
